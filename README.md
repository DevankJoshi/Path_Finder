# Path Quest - Pathfinding Visualizer

![Path Quest Demo](demo.gif)  
*Note: Replace 'demo.gif' with an actual screenshot or screen recording of your application*

An interactive web application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms. Watch algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, and DFS navigate through a grid while avoiding walls! Perfect for educational purposes or algorithm enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**  
  Click and drag to place start/end nodes and walls
- **Multiple Algorithms**  
  Visualize 4 different pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Maze Generation**  
  Generate random mazes using recursive division
- **Real-time Visualization**  
  Animated node exploration and path tracing
- **Performance Metrics**  
  Timer shows algorithm execution time
- **Responsive Design**  
  Clean UI with Bootstrap components
- **Visual Customization**  
  Unique colors for different algorithms and path elements
